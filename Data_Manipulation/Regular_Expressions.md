# Introduction

Regular expressions (AKA "Regex") can be thought of as a pattern of characters that describes a specific set of strings with a common structure. String functions can take a character variable and a regular expression, and show you how they match. Regex is useful for extracting information from text such as documents, spreadsheets, log files, and code.  They can be used for string matching / replacing, and are supported across several programming languages such as Python, R, Stata, SQL, and more.

# Implementations

## NAME OF LANGUAGE/SOFTWARE 1

```identifier for language type, see this page: https://github.com/jmm/gfm-lang-ids/wiki/GitHub-Flavored-Markdown-%28GFM%29-language-IDs
Commented code demonstrating the technique
```

## NAME OF LANGUAGE/SOFTWARE 2 WHICH HAS MULTIPLE APPROACHES

There are two ways to perform this technique in language/software 2.

First, explanation of what is different about the first way:
