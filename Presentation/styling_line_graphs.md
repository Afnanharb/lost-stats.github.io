# Styling Line Graphs 
There are several ways of styling line graphs. The following examples demonstrate how to modify the appearances of the lines 
(type and sizes), as well chart titles and axes labels.   

## Keep in Mind
- To get started on how to plot line graphs, see [here](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/line_graph_with_labels_at_the_beginning_or_end.html).
- For help with scatter plots see [here](https://lost-stats.github.io/Presentation/scatterplot_by_group_on_shared_axes.html).

# Implementation 

## R
```{r illustration}
## load packages
library(ggplot2)

## load data (the Economics dataset is one of the datasets preloaded in R) 
eco_df <- economics

## basic plot
p1 <- ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y = uempmed), data = eco_df)
p1

## Change line color and chart labels 
p2 <- ggplot() +
  ## choose a color of preference
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y = uempmed), color = "navyblue", data = eco_df) +
  ## add chart title and change axes labels
  labs(
    title = "Median Duration of Unemployment", 
    x = "year",
    y = "") +
  ## center the chart title
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
p2

## plotting multiple charts (of different line types and sizes)
p3 <-ggplot() +
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y = uempmed), color = "navyblue", 
            size = 1.5, data = eco_df) +
  geom_line(aes(x=date, y = psavert), color = "red2", 
            linetype = "dotted", size = 0.8, data = eco_df) +
  labs(
    title = "Unemployment Duration (Blue) and Savings Rate (Red)", 
    x = "year",
    y = "") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) 

p3
```
The three plots generated by the code above as as follows:
